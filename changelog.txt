JumpTest 0.4.2 - 04.02.12
Added:
*Score counter
*menu-type placeholders (Press Enter to get into the game when in one such menu)
*multiple resolution support (code-wise. Still can't change your resolutions)	
*"current version" message at the bottom.

Changed:
*Game resolution. Was 800x600, is 1280x1024. 
*various values (jump height to test bigger resolution, platform speed)
*The ability to re-load platforms is back. For now.

Fixed:
*A broken loop loading a nonexistant part of an array crashing the game

Bugs:
*Platforms randomly appear and dissapear. Will try to fix this later.
*Main menu doesn't appear in the released version

Notes:
*Collision detection is still in works, and the sides of the platform will not cause collision detection to activate.
*Need moar platforms
*The original files were made for 800x600, hence the box-type problem.


JumpTest 0.4.1 (No client backup available) - 02.02.12
Added:
It's now possible to autoupdate the game from http://zingmars.net78.net/updates (free servers + .net updater ahoy!)

JumpTest 0.4 - 02.02.12
Added:
*Collision detection!
 *Right now it's kind of primitive - it checks for the center of both player and platform
 *and will do its thing if they're close. It's primitive because it's not really precise
*More platforms to make the collision detection easier to test
*Jumping on a platform should make you jump even higher!
Changed:
*Jumping is back!
*The pseudo-random platform generation is nov even more pseudo-random, as the value is seeded with the current ToD.
Removed:
*The screen is no longer scrolling all the time
Notes:
*The platforms will stack up. It's not exactly a bug, but it's not a feature either. I'll have to change the algorithm a bit.
*Source code included!

JumpTest 0.3.2 - 02.02.12
Added:
*Platforms will now randomly change their x coordinates when re-appearing at the top of the screen

Changed:
*The platforms will now be initalized when the game is loaded, instead of the Update(); method

Removed:
*You can no longer manually re-generate platforms.

Notes: This project will be now cloned. The code I have right now will be used for a future project called
"Rainbow crash". This project however will be continued to produce a doodle-jump type game.

JumpTest 0.3.1 - 01.02.12
Added:
*Testing out scrolling. 
 *Platforms will now re-appear at the top of the screen when below the client window!

Changed:
*The player can no longer jump, and will move upwards at all times. This is to test my primitive way of scrolling.
*Nov every platform has different x and y coordinates instead of both being the same. Fixed the stairs bug!

Notes:
*Going to add platform re-assigning soon.
*I'll need to reserve more space for more platforms soon

JumpTest 0.3 - 01.02.12
Removed:
*Exit
*Any use of the 'new' platform spawning algorithm

Changed:
*Nothing, except some minor things related to platform spawning.

Added:
*Randomly generated platforms! FINALLY!

Bugs:
*For some reason whenever I generate platforms, they seem to stutter, not to mention they look like stairs. I think I need to seed the random function to fix this!

Notes:
*Apparently coordinates no longer display weird values when you land. That's awesome!
*That code added in 0.2.1 is probably going to be removed soon. The way I did random platform spawning doesn't really use it.
*Also including source code with this
*Press "R" to regenerate platforms

JumpTest 0.2.1 - 01.02.12
Removed:
*platforms
Added:
*code that allows me to spawn platforms everywhere
*single lone platform in the middle of the screen to test a certain thing

JumpTest 0.2 - 31.01.12
The second version. Removed a lot of things. No installer, as functionality seems to be broken :/
Features added: 
*Proper jumping code. Now uses gravity and all that good stuff. 
*The player will now try to catch up with the mouse instead of moving with the mouse, giving a cool movement effect.
Bugs: [Fixed]
*For some reason the Y coordinate seems to be messed up when the player lands,  while the player seems to be
at the right place. No idea what causes this, and if it's just my code failing to update the 'Y' counter.
I guess I have to be at the lookout.

JumpTest 0.1 - 22.01.12
The first version. Supposedly is a full game. Also has installer.
Features added:
*Jumping works. Kind of. See bug 1.
*Collision works. Also kind of. Also you can jump off from platforms! yay!
*The exit kind of works. See bug 2.
Bugs: [Both fixed in newer versions]
*Jumps fail when the player reaches next lowest platoform +player height. When there's no more platforms in sight -
there aren't any problems. 
*Just move to the right side of the screen to 'win'. Caused by buggy 'if' check.
